# Google-Dorks
"Google Dorks" refers to advanced search techniques used with Google to retrieve information that is not easily accessible through standard search queries. By using specific search operators, a user can narrow down their search results or uncover hidden data. These operators are commonly used for research, penetration testing, or finding specific types of publicly available data.

## Common Google Dorks and Their Uses

### Basic Search Operators

1. **`site:`**
   Limits results to a specific domain.
   Example: `site:example.com`

2. **`intitle:`**
   Finds pages with a specific keyword in the title.
   Example: `intitle:"login"`

3. **`inurl:`**
   Searches for keywords in the URL.
   Example: `inurl:admin`

4. **`filetype:`**
   Searches for specific file types (e.g., PDFs, DOCs).
   Example: `filetype:pdf "financial report"`

5. **`ext:`**
   Similar to `filetype:`, finds files with specific extensions.
   Example: `ext:xlsx "budget"`

### Advanced Techniques

1. **`cache:`**
   Views a cached version of a webpage.
   Example: `cache:example.com`

2. **`related:`**
   Finds websites similar to the specified one.
   Example: `related:example.com`

3. **`allintitle:`**
   Searches for multiple keywords in the title.
   Example: `allintitle:secure login`

4. **`allinurl:`**
   Finds URLs containing all specified keywords.
   Example: `allinurl:admin login`

### Combining Operators

You can combine multiple operators to refine searches further.
Example: `site:gov filetype:pdf "budget"`

### Ethical Considerations

Google Dorking is a legitimate tool for information gathering but can also be used maliciously to uncover sensitive or improperly secured information. Always ensure your actions comply with ethical guidelines and local laws. For example:

* Do not access private or unauthorized data.
* Use these techniques only for lawful and ethical purposes.
